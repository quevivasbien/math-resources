    "1.  The total number of possible rolls is $12^4$. There are 12 different\n",
    "    ways to get a “Yeetzah” (one for each number that could be rolled).\n",
    "    So the probability of a “Yeetzah” is $$\\frac{12}{12^4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The first thing we need to figure out is how many sets of rolls\n",
    "    there are that contain consecutive, distinct numbers. The possible\n",
    "    sets are\n",
    "    $$\\{1,2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5,6\\}, \\dots, \\{9,10,11,12\\}$$\n",
    "    There are 9 different sets that work. We need to remember that,\n",
    "    since the order of the rolls doesn’t matter as long as they all end\n",
    "    up being distinct and consecutive, any ordering of the above sets is\n",
    "    fine. The number of ways to order a set of 4 elements is\n",
    "    $$4! = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$$ So for each of the 9\n",
    "    allowable sets, there are 24 orderings that work. The total number\n",
    "    of allowable options is therefore $9 \\cdot 24$. Thus the probability\n",
    "    of a straight is $$\\frac{9 \\cdot 24}{12^4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  One way to figure out the number of possible ways to get all four\n",
    "    dice to be different is to think about assigning them numbers\n",
    "    consecutively. There are 12 allowable options for the first die. For\n",
    "    each of those 12 options, there are 11 remaining options for the\n",
    "    second die. For each of those there are 10 for the third, and for\n",
    "    each of those there are 9 for the fourth. The total number of\n",
    "    allowable options is therefore $12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9$. You\n",
    "    can also think about this as a permutation problem: The number of\n",
    "    possible orderings of $k$ items from $n$ total is $n!/(n-k)!$ In\n",
    "    this case, we have $12!/8!$, which is equivalent to what we got\n",
    "    before. At any rate, the probability is the number of allowable\n",
    "    rolls divided by the number of total rolls, which is\n",
    "    $$\\frac{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{12^4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  There are 12 ways to chose the number that is repeated three times\n",
    "    and for each of those ways, there are 11 ways to choose the other\n",
    "    number. For each choice of numbers, there are 4 ways to arrange them\n",
    "    (since the number rolled only once can go in one of four “spots”).\n",
    "    So the number of ways to get three-of-a-kind is\n",
    "    $12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 4$, and the probability is\n",
    "    $$\\frac{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 4}{12^4}$$\n",
